# A Docker-Based Environment for Data Science

One of the biggest challenges faced by those who teach data science is providing reliable, reproducible environments for their students to work in.  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) has done an amazing job of easing this pain, but reproducibility is presents a problem as each student will likely be running different versions of different operating systems that have been tweaked in unpredictable ways.  This project is an attempt to leverage [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for creating reproducible linux enviroments for students regardless of their operating system and configuration.

# Prerequisits
* Operating systems:  **Windows 10 Pro** or **Mac-OSX** or **Linux**
* A [Docker Installation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


Think about making this image a zip file that can be dumped into a directory so that users don't have to install github on their pcs
